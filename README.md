## Goal of the project :dart:

This repository contains the work done for the course of ***Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications*** at Politecnico di Milano (Italy). 
The goal of the course was to design a "mobile" application in which the user experience assumes a central role, starting from how the various elements characterizing the UI should be disposed to how users should interact with them.
Beertastic was thought to provide users with a smooth and joyful way to approach to the beer and brewery worlds, by offering the possibility to read articles, see events, search beers and exchange opinions.
This document presents a functional specification of the architectural components defining the system as well as their interfaces and interactions, and make use of graphs to expose better their relationships and behaviours.
